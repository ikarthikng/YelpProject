[('As a vegan, I try to support places that are not wholly vegetarian, but that made the effort to put a vegetarian section on their menu, to show them that it\'s worth keeping. Thai Singha House does indeed have a section of their menu that reads vegetarian, but, unfortunately, their definition of vegetarian is different from mine.\n\nAll of the vegetarian curries, I was fortunately informed upon asking, do indeed contain fish sauce, which is an ingredient in the curry itself, and cannot be omitted.\n\nMy server suggested the pad thai as a fish-free vegetarian alternative, which I ordered, holding the egg. When it arrived, there appeared to be tofu in there and no egg, which was a good sign. But after a few blind, trusting bites I quickly realized that there was also chicken or pork mixed in as well. My server graciously took it back and honored my request for a house salad, of which I wasn\'t charged.\n\nI don\'t blame Thai Singha House for not understanding the definition of vegetarian (sadly, I know a few "vegetarians" who just don\'t eat red meat) although there are non-vegetarian Thai restaurants that get it and get it right, like Tamarind on South Street. \n\nSo, it\'s up to us as consumers to ask questions beforehand if we\'re not totally sure.

Not only that, upon realizing that he is splashing people with Coke, he doesn\'t even apologize, but instead just places extra napkins on each table for us to wipe ourselves off with. Are you kidding me?? A guy sitting on another table alerts the manager about the Coke splashed on him and the manager tells him his entree is free.

Then half that amount of seeded jalape\xf1os and garlic, then half that amount of a spice blend of equal parts cumin and salt and one cheap beer and one handful of cilantro for every onion you put in.  Bam! Beans with flavor. \n\nBacon, get a big oven tray, lay out thick-cut pieces and stick them in the oven.  This lets them stay plump, cook all the way and get browned without getting small hard and crumbly.  This will also save you tons of labor as you can set a timer and just have one person pop them in and out between doing other work.  If you want to make refried bean (which is the only thing you should be putting on tacos) take the bacon drippings and add them to some beans and blend.  Nothing wasted.\n\nMigas:  NEVER PRECOOK YOUR VEGGIES, prep a mix of seeded and chopped jalape\xf1os (yes you can get a seeding tool at restaurant supply that lets you do this fast [$5] so no excuses) chopped onion, chopped cilantro, sliced mushroom.  Get THIN TORTILLA CHIPs like Milagros, they don\'t get soggy and ON HIGH HEAT put them in the oil first, hit the chips with a season blend of equal parts: salt, garlic powder, cumin, paprika.  Then a hand full your veggie mix,  brown edges of veggies, then add egg and done.  \n\nAnyone still reading this now knows this isn\'t hard and thus understands why it is so lame to get bland goofed up tacos.

When we got there, the only full tables were the patio seats. Pretty much the whole inside dining room was empty, leading us to believe they had a certain amount of tables set aside for guests of the hotel. Had we been able to get reservations earlier, our experience might have been different.\n\nLet's start with the apps. My greens and smoked salmon was a decent but not fantastic opener. She had the crabcake which was definitely better. The crabcake had enough fresh cooked crabmeat to make it different than the traditional offering, but also had enough flavor to be noteworthy. Smoked salmon is still smoked salmon, even when you add what is supposed to be a bacon seasoning which I didn't taste at all. I guess I was expecting naively that I would be getting something a little more inspired based on the menu description. \n\nFrom there the meal took a severe nose dive. I ordered the lamb shank in a port wine reduction with a side of roasted potatoes. Roasted potatoes are hard to mess up, but HT did. I was given a generous helping of dry and under-seasoned things. The lamb was so drenched in the port wine sauce that it could have been roast pork I was eating and I would not have known the difference. Lamb is one of the more flavorful meats but when you drench it in a sauce that would overpower the flavor of calves liver, you know you have gone down the wrong culinary path. My girlfriend's salmon was dry but tasted decent enough. The flavor wasn't abundant but it was there.\n\nWe finished off with the chocolate bread pudding and the amaretto cheesecake. These desserts were both great and by the second bite, I was thinking that we had just bought $33 desserts. The bread pudding as rich as it was still packed a whole lot of chocolate and banana flavor that would have been finished to the last bite had we been enjoying ourselves more. I really liked the cheesecake as it wasn't too heavy but was creamy and tasty. -I was searching for the amaretto flavor, but decided it was amaretto by default by the top coating of thinly sliced roasted almonds.\n\nOur drinks were also a factor in the rating.

It ended up being a watered down version of a margarita with a hint of tequila and no evidence that the bartender gave consideration to the drink menu.

(three surgeries for stenosis, on all three levels of spine, two done at Stanford). His answer "I know nothing about that" (though he had all my records in front of him). Then I asked him how small my spinal cord had to be before surgery would be done (it is "severely stenotic" in several places on MRI, e.g. 5 mm across, and I am essentially unable to stand or walk). He said "No one will do anything until no \'white area\' [spinal cord viewed on MRI] is visible at all. We only operate when the disk is gone and bone rubs on bone." (This is not my problem.) He repeated this information, about disks and bone-on-bone, slowly and with exaggerated patience. He told me that what I had, severe stenosis, was a "just part of aging, like wrinkles." Then he mentioned "You probably have a fracture." I asked him what I could do about that and he said "That\'s not my problem, is it?" (Numerous studies and practitioners have viewed my spine in the last two years, and I\'ve heard nothing about a fracture.) At about this point, he picked up his dictation device and, as if to tell us it was over, began dictating in our presence. I listened as long as I could (he misrepresented what I had said, saying I\'d sought a diagnosis from "several doctors," which is not true - only one other local neurosurgeon, who suggested I come to Stanford). That was my visit, aside from being sent to X-ray to confirm the fracture. I was left thinking that: every doctor I\'d seen (the neurologist who\'d done my EMG and told me that "this will get you surgery," the radiologists who\'d read my MRIs and X-rays, my primary who referred me to Stanford Neurosurgery, my rheumatologist, and the one other neurosurgeon I\'d consulted), were all crazy or incompetent.

The meal came out in fragments - the meat came out about 10 minutes before the veggies, and the "broth" had been boiling away for some time when we finally got to start cooking.

I have a wider, square face and I tend to look like a block on a stick (my neck) when I get blunt cuts. REALLY unflattering.\n3) DON\'T touch my bangs because I decided I wanted to grow them back out.\n\nWhat did Hannah do? Take off over 2" of length all around to give me a blocky, old lady blunt cut and she CUT MY BANGS before I had a chance to even respond.

At that point she was like "oops I already cut them" and I had to let her even them out unless I wanted to go home with one section of bangs that was obviously shorter than the rest.\n\nWhile the layers and the rest of the cut was fine, it was clear that the comprehension wasn\'t there-- what about "don\'t touch the bangs and don\'t give me a blunt cut" is so hard for a stylist to understand?!\n\nJust to add insult to injury, after being told on the phone that there was a student discount of $5 for a haircut, I was told in person at the cash register that they don\'t honor student discounts for a haircut with Hannah!

I ordered a grilled crispy chicken salad that was supposed to come with butter lettuce, radicchio and blue cheese dressing, and bacon, in that order.  The radicchio was very much predominant, which made the whole thing very bitter and I was actually unable to eat it.  The blue cheese dressing was more aptly blue-cheese flavored dressing, at a stretch, since it was the consistency of non-fat milk, and there was not a speck of blue cheese to actually be seen, let alone a chunk.  It tasted like watered-down Wish Bone from a bottle.  When I told the waitress that the salad was actually awful, she argued, telling me that "some people like it."  After she realized that I was not going to eat it, she offered to replace the radicchio with butter lettuce.  I should have held on to the chicken, which did initially live up to the description, crispy, thin sliced breast meat.  On the return, the chicken was underdone, in some places pink, so it was slimy.  \n\nMy son\'s meal, a vegetarian dish was as he described it, reminiscent of a cafeteria.

My husband\'s hamburger was ok, but when we got the bill, it was nearly $100 for what was essentially snack food for three, no real entree with say a large cut of meat to justify that tab.

It's a HUGE portion of food that could be split between two not-totally-starving people. It includes a pretty decent vegetable miso soup, corn bread with tahini miso spread (the cornbread was hearty but a bit on the drier side - also different from conventional cornbread in that it's made of brown rice), as well as a huge plate brown rice, arame seaweed (so good), steamed veggies (boring but then again they're veggies), garbanzo beans, a delicious cabbage salad (somewhere between cole slaw and sauerkraut), and pickled beets!

We started petting them and I Immediately noticed a big pile of poop in their crate.  I brought it to the workers attention that was behind the counter and he ordered someone else to clean up the mess.  All the dogs inside were barking and begging for attention.  One large dog was climbing over his crate (tall fences/gates) cause he wanted to get out.  As we went further in, I noticed more poop in another crate and told the guy cleaning the 1st poop that there was more poop here.  This dog was jumping up and down and was about to land in his own poop.  Oh, by the way, he was tied so if he managed to climb over this fence, the dog would choke to death by hanging himself.  \n\nThen I noticed the little dogs behind the windows.....\nMy heart melted and asked if I could play with one of them.  The guy behind the counter was kind enough to bring the cutest one out of his crate and let me play with this him inside the store.  I noticed more poop behind the windows and told the worker.  He went inside the room and started cleaning their little messes.  Most of the smaller dogs were living in these small spaces with their own feces.  It was really sad.  \n\nOn the window, they had a sign posted telling customers to let the front desk know if we see feces in their crates.  Seriously?  Why are they not doing their only job!!??  Is is that hard to make a habit of checking their beds/crates for feces every half hour or at least by the hour!!  \n\nWhile playing with the little puppy, I noticed the puppy had matted fur and did not look like he was cared for.

There are times that I've had to park my car and wait for 15 minutes just for someone to come out of the gym so I can follow them to get their parking spot. This is acceptable at a mall, but not at a place I'm paying for.\n\n2. Ohhh, THE SMELL! I get that this is a place for sweating but the smell in this gym is beyond what you should have to endure during your workout.  It smells like they've never aired out the place or opened a window. It's just offensive.\n\n3. BROKEN, BROKEN, BROKEN. Everything is broken here, and I'm not just talking about the equipment. I stopped going to this gym for a while because their AC broke and it took them 4 weeks to fix it.  NO AC at a gym for 4 weeks!?!? Unbelievable.\n\n4. CROWDED CLASSES. Some of the classes have WAY too many people in them, to the point that you don't even have enough space to work out in. The staff at LA fitness will never regulate this and you'll have to attempt to work out in a 2'x2' square. Go ahead, try out the Monday 5:45 step class. If you like slamming into other sweaty people, you'll enjoy it.\n\nThe only good part of this gym is the Tuesday yoga class at 8pm. Great teacher. \n\nGOOD LUCK GYM HUNTING!!!", 'neg'), ("I don't get this place.  At all.  They don't offer anything innovating or different.  Tank tops for $20.00????

Jersey knit dresses/skirts for $40.00.  WHY do people buy this crap??? Go to Target or Old Navy and you can get the same shit for pennies compared to the prices here.\n\nThe staff is friendly, but it's like they all call each other up in the morning to discuss what they are going to wear.

Basically just about every UT student has been to Trudy\'s at least once since it\'s within walking distance from the campus, and the management of Trudy\'s has used this fact to their economic advantage by jacking up the prices on every item that this white-washed "Mexican" food joint has to offer. That being said, as an Austinite and UT student, I had always accepted Trudy\'s existence with mild indifference. If I were to lead a campaign against every restaurant geared to con college students out of money, then I wouldn\'t have anywhere to eat on the drag. \n\nMoving along, last night was my birthday and for those "in the know" that means that one can get a free drink of their choice at Trudy\'s with an ID proving DOB. Some friends of mine were going there anyway so I thought "what could possibly go wrong?!" and headed down there after work. \n\nOur orders were taken by this snippy waitress who insisted that we turn in all of our IDs so that the manager could approve them. I initially thought it was odd until I saw another wide-eyed waitress standing behind her, so I shrugged it off as she was probably just showing off for the trainee, handed over my ID and waited for them to approve it. About a minute later, a different waiter returns and doles out the ID\'s but stops at my friend who we\'ll call Karl and asks if he has a Texas ID. Karl has lived in many different states and as a result has about 3 different ones from each place. A policeman stole his Texas ID (the story of which is for a different yelp review) and so he only had the 2 ID\'s from other states. They explained to him that they could only take a Texas ID for liquor, even though he had multiple forms of identification proving his age to be 25. Ridiculous. Oh well, at least we got our food - which wasn\'t half bad, hence the 2 stars.\n\nI was given a Mexican Martini (Which to be fair - was good and quite alcoholic) and I offered Karl a drink of it out of sympathy. He obliged and 5 seconds later the diligent waitress was at the head of our table with a self-satisfied smirk asking quite loudly if Karl had a valid identification on him. He showed her both of his ID\'s and she turned them all down while loudly proclaiming that it was THE RULES and if he was going to DISRESPECT THE RULES then he would have to leave. We couldn\'t reason with her on any level because her response to every line was "THAT\'S JUST THE RULES". Thankfully she didn\'t do anything rash and eventually leaved. We laughed about it and waited until she was far out of sight so Karl could take another swig of my martini. Well apparently they had the entire staff on "RED ALERT: ALL EYES ON 25 YEAR OLD MALE DRINKING IN OUR RESTAURANT" and immediately we were guerrilla-style assaulted by a waiter who had been hiding in the shadows just waiting for Karl to take another sip. He began snatching all the unfinished drinks off the table and said it was because "there couldn\'t be anybody with invalid IDs drinking" and somehow everyone\'s drinks were compromised. Thankfully I kept a firm grip on my glass so it couldn\'t be confiscated. A minute later the manager was at the head of the table telling Karl and I that we needed to leave the premises immediately. Our food was already finished in its entirety and there was only a little bit of martini left in the shaker, so I downed the rest while Karl took 4 huge bites of food, and.... We did exactly what the manager ordered and left.

I'm usually hesitant to dine at hotel restaurants for no good reason other than the wiring in my brain.\n \nThe weather was beautiful and I was excited that we had the option of patio seating. The host was welcoming, the server was pleasant. The blackberry margarita was making the whining of the children at surrounding tables a bit more toned down. The first appetizer arrived and I was mortified. The Island Creek Oysters appeared to have been shucked the day beforehand. There was no brine, the oysters were gummy and fishy smelling. When you tipped the shell sideways, they didn't even move. We sent them back, thankful we had ordered a second appetizer. The second appetizer was ok, small in portion but it was a tasty goat cheese stuffed portobello mushroom. By the time the entrees arrived I was beginning to get hungry.\n\n I ordered the sirloin steak with chive-topped mashed potatoes. It was cooked to temperature, it looked pretty with the grill marks but it was lacking. The second bite was all gristle. For a thirty dollar price tag, I was expected to have my socks knocked off. All I could taste in the demi-glace was a thickening agent, like corn starch or something. I sent it back. My boyfriend's pulled lamb shank was decent, the roasted root vegetables were delicious but again, all I could taste in the gravy was a thickener.

Maybe she didn't ask what the problem with the steak was because she wanted to make it as painless as possible. She didn't offer any suggestions or excuses. Maybe the oysters that we ordered were the restaurants' last. Maybe the person that shucks the oysters wasn't around. Why we weren't offered fresh oysters is beyond me.

I told her that we would go over to Legal Seafoods, across the way, so I could eat dinner.\n\nTo top it all off, the server forgot to give me back my debit card. The food runner was sent over to Legal Seafoods to give it back to me. The one star I gave this reveiw was for that and that only.

Most of the tables were empty, but not in their usual places.  We were squished into the corner next to the one other table with people.\nAfter we ordered, the wait staff started breaking down the tables and moving them all over the restaurant.  Our table was shaking like a San Francisco earthquake!\nThank God it only took about 10 minutes.
